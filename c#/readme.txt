This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in C#. The player is prompted to enter either "ROCK", "PAPER", or "SCISSORS", while the computer randomly selects one of the three choices. The game then compares the player's choice with the computer's and displays the resultâ€”win, lose, or draw. After each round, the player is asked if they want to play again. The loop continues until the player chooses to quit.
